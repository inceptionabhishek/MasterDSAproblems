Day 1 : Problems

| Q.No | Problem Name 🙏 | Main Approach 🙈 | Link :/ |
| :--: | --------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
|1. | Set Matrix Zeroes | My idea is simple: store states of each row in the first of that row, and store states of each column in the first of that column. Because the state of row0 and the state of column0 would occupy the same cell, I let it be the state of row0, and use another variable "col0" for column0. In the first phase, use matrix elements to set states in a top-down way. In the second phase, use states to set matrix elements in a bottom-up way. | https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/ |
|2. |Pascal Triangle | Simply add the previous two values of the array at given row and resize the column according to the size of the current column | https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/ |
